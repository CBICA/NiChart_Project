Pseudocode description of NiChart_Project:

INPUT: User data files, pipeline selection
OUTPUT: Processed results and downloadable outputs

1. INITIALIZE application (desktop or cloud mode)

2. DATA UPLOAD phase:
   - Accept user data files
   - Validate file formats and integrity
   - Store data in working directory

3. PIPELINE SELECTION phase:
   - Display available pipelines
   - Filter pipelines compatible with uploaded data format
   - User selects pipeline P from compatible set

4. COMPATIBILITY CHECK phase:
   - Analyze requirements of pipeline P
   - Check uploaded data against requirements
   - IF data incomplete or incompatible THEN:
       - Prompt user for additional/corrected data
       - GOTO step 2
   - ENDIF

5. PIPELINE EXECUTION phase:
   - Load pipeline P configuration
   - FOR each stage S in pipeline P DO:
       - Execute computational stage S on data
       - Validate intermediate outputs
       - IF stage fails THEN report error and halt
   - ENDFOR

6. RESULTS PRESENTATION phase:
   - Generate visualizations and summaries
   - Display results in application interface
   - Provide download options for:
       - Raw output files
       - Processed data
       - Analysis reports

7. TERMINATE or return to step 2 for new analysis
