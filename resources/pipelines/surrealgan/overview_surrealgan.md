### Surreal-GAN Prediction: Estimation of Semi-Supervised Representation Learning via GAN for uncovering heterogeneous disease-related imaging patterns

<p>A lightweight knowledge distillation method for estimating SurrealGAN R-indices, low dimensional representations of disease-related heterogeneity, where each dimension indicates the severity of one relatively homogeneous imaging patterns.</p>


#### Input

- T1-weighted scans (Nifti)


#### Output

- Estimated SurrealGAN R-indices (csv file)
