    ### How to use this pipeline ‚ùì
    - **Follow the Steps:** Proceed through the pipeline steps on the left.
    - **Data Flow:** The output of each step automatically becomes the input for the next.
    - **Flexibility:** You can skip steps if you already have the required data for subsequent steps.

    ### Required user data üß†
    - **MRI Scans:** One or more T1-weighted MRI scan(s) as input, provided in either DICOM or NIfti format.
    - **Demographics:** A CSV file containing essential demographic information.

        This file must include at least:
        - MRID: Unique identifier for the subject (scan timepoint)
        - Age: Age of the subject.
        - Sex: Sex of the subject (M/F).

    Optionally, include:
        - DX: Diagnosis (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Control (CN)).
        - SITE: The site where the MRI scans were acquired (used to define scanner batches for harmonization)

    - **DLMUSE ROI Volumes (Optional):** If you have already segmented your MRI data using the DLMUSE method, you can provide the resulting ROI (Region of Interest) volumes in CSV format. This can speed up the process.
