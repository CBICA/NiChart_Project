<h1>pNet Report</h1>
<text style="font-size:24px;">
    This is a report summarizing the results obtained using pNet. <br />
    pNet is an open-source toolbox <a href="https://github.com/MLDataAnalytics/pNet" target="_blank">(GitHub link)</a> for computing personalized functional networks from fMRI data. <br />
    pNet is developed by a team of <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/machine-learning-biomed-data/" target="_blank">(lab link)</a>. <br />
    Report is generated at {$report_time$}

<h2>Essential settings for this pNet workflow</h2>
<text style="font-size:20px;">
    The personalized functional network modeling is {$pnet_FN_method$}. <br />
    The number of FNs is set to {$K$}. <br />
    The fMRI data type is '{$dataType$}' with format as '{$dataFormat$}.' <br />
    The whole fMRI dataset contains {$nScan$} scans from {$nSubject$} subjects. <br />
    Parameters for the data input are stored in './Data_Input/Setting.json'<br />
    Parameters for the personalized FN modeling are stored in './FN_Computation/Setting.json' <br />

<h2>Personalized Functional Networks (pFNs)</h2>
<text style="font-size:20px;">
    A few examples of personalized FNs derived from several subjects are shown as below. <br />

<h2>Quality Control (QC)</h2>
<text style="font-size:20px;">
    The QC examines spatial correspondence and functional coherence of personalized FNs to ensure that the personalized FNs have higher functional homogeneity than their group-level counterparts and maintain good spatial correspondence with their group-level counterparts.  <br />

</p>
<text style="font-size:20px;">
    The delta spatial correspondence measures the minimum difference of spatial similarity between pFNs and their group counterparts. <br />
    The functional coherence measures the average of weighted mean of the correlation coefficients between the time courses of each FN and vertex/voxel. <br />
    <br />
    Failed scans will show negative delta spatial correspondence, indicating that there is at least one pFN has higher spatial similarity to a different gFN. <br />
    The personalized FNs show enhanced functional coherence while maintaining spatial correspondence to their group counterparts. <br />
