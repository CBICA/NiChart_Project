24.0.1 (July 16, 2024)
======================
Bug fix release in the 24.0.x series.

This release resolves a bug with multi-volume single-band references.
If multiple volumes are found, they are processed in the same way as
the BOLD series is processed to produce a motion-correction reference.

* FIX: Validate and summarize multi-volume sbrefs (#3320)
* DOC: Address errors/warnings in RTD builds (#3325)
* DOC: Read html_baseurl from RTD environment, if available (#3324)


24.0.0 (June 17, 2024)
======================
New feature release in the 24.0.x series.

This release is an incremental improvement on 23.2.x, with some
fixes for bugs discovered in the updated workflow.

New features include separation of HTML reports by session for subjects
with many BOLD runs, a new ``--fs-no-resume`` option to improve interoperability
with less typical FreeSurfer directories, such as those generated by longitudinal
FreeSurfer or FastSurfer, and adoption of DatasetLinks and BIDS-URIs, to follow
the recommendations of recent versions of BIDS.

With thanks to Dimitri Papadopoulos, Basile Pinsard, Celine Provins, Taylor Salo
and Wang Hao-Ting for their contributions!

=====================
Bug fix release in the 23.2.x series.

Fixes an issue with broken connections, which only affects ``--level resampling``.

* FIX: Add datasink fill-in step to resampling level (#3254)


23.2.1 (March 06, 2024)
=======================
Bug fix release in the 23.2.x series.

Masks, BOLD references and T2\* maps resampled into template spaces had
their order of transforms inverted. BOLD files were unaffected.

This release also preserves the TR in the NIfTI header of BOLD series.

* FIX: Flip order of transforms in ``init_ds_volumes_wf`` (#3238)
* DOCKER: restore mincinfo binary (#3249)
* CI: Move to new CircleCI machine tags (#3247)


23.2.0 (January 10, 2024)
=========================
New feature release in the 23.2.x series.

This release wraps up a significant refactor of fMRIPrep. The main new features
can be used with the ``--level`` and ``--derivatives`` flags.

The ``--level`` flag can take the arguments ``minimal``, ``resampling`` or
``full``. The default is ``full``, which should produce nearly the same results
as previous versions. ``minimal`` will produce only the minimum necessary to
deterministically generate the remaining derivatives. ``resampling`` will produce
some additional derivatives, intended to simplify resampling with other tools.

The ``--derivatives`` flag takes arguments of the form ``name=/path/to/dir``,
for example ``--derivatives anat=$SMRIPREP_DIR``.  If provided, fMRIPrep will
read the specified directories for pre-computed derivatives. If a derivative is
found, it will be used instead of computing it from scratch. If a derivative is
not found, fMRIPrep will compute it and proceed as usual.

Taken together, these features can allow a dataset provider to run a minimal
fMRIPrep run, targeting many output spaces, while a user can then run a
``--derivatives`` run to generate additional derivatives in only the output
spaces they need. Another use case is to provide an precomputed derivative
to override the default fMRIPrep behavior, enabling easier workarounds for
bugs or experimentation with alternatives.

Additionally, this release includes a number of bug fixes and improvements.
This release adds support for MSM-Sulc, improving the alignment of subject
surfaces to the fsLR template. This process is enabled by default, but may
be disabled with the ``--no-msm`` flag.

This release resolves a number of issues with fieldmaps inducing distortions
during correction. Phase difference and direct fieldmaps are now masked correctly,
preventing the overestimation of distortions outside the brain. Additionally,
we now implement Jacobian weighting during unwarping, which corrects for compression
and expansion effects on signal intensity. To disable Jacobian weighting, use
``--ignore fmap-jacobian``.

Finally, a new resampling method has been added, to better account for
susceptibility distortion and motion in a single shot resampling to a volumetric
target space. We anticipate extending this to surface targets in the future.

23.1.4 (August 1, 2023)
=======================
Patch release in the 23.1.x series.

This release prioritizes single-band reference BOLD images during SyN-SDC schemes.
Additionally, an indices inconsistency was fixed for CIFTI volumetric data.

* FIX: Pass sbref files to SyN workflow (#3060)
* FIX: Generate CIFTI volume structure indices in column-major order (nipreps/niworkflows#815)


23.1.3 (June 24, 2023)
======================

Bug fix release in the 23.1.x series.

In rare cases where Freesurfer is unable to align to its default atlas in
Talairach registration, it was unable to fall back to the Schwartz atlas
because we were not including it in the Docker image. This release exists
to provide an updated Docker image, and no upgrade is needed for users not
encountering this issue.

* DOCKER: Include 3T18yoSchwartzReactN32 FreeSurfer atlas in image (#3049)


23.1.2 (June 16, 2023)
======================

Bug fix release in the 23.1.x series.

This release correctly generates ``*_space-fsLR_desc-reg_sphere.surf.gii``,
which was previously a copy of the standard ``*_desc-reg_sphere.surf.gii``.
Additionally, warnings are now correctly emitted when AROMA-related CLI
options are used.

* CI: Clean up pre-release builds (#3040)


23.1.1 (June 14, 2023)
======================

Bug fix release in the 23.1.x series.

This release corrects a small error that prevented the "goodvoxels" mask from
being placed in the output directory if no FreeSurfer output spaces were specified.

* FIX: Remove bad metadata input from ds_goodvoxels_mask (#3037)


23.1.0 (June 12, 2023)
======================
New feature release in the 23.1.x series.

This release substantially reworks the resampling to fsLR grayordinate space,
better accounting for partial volumes and high variance voxels. If you are
resampling using ``--project-goodvoxels``, we strongly recommend upgrading.

Fieldmap handling is improved, with better preference given to single-band
references in both PEPolar and SyN-SDC schemes. Additionally, fMRIPrep will
no longer estimate fieldmaps that are not intended to be used to correct BOLD
series, reducing unneeded processing.

This release removes ICA-AROMA from the fMRIPrep workflow. To use ICA-AROMA,
set ``MNI152NLin6Asym:res-2`` as a target output space. MELODIC and ICA-AROMA
can be run on the resulting images in a separate pipeline. For further
information on the reasoning behind this change, see
`GitHub issue #2936 <https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/issues/2936>`__.

This release increments the versions of ANTs and FSL bundled in the Docker
image.

With thanks to Eilidh MacNicol, Basille Pinsard and Taylor Salo for contributions
in fMRIPrep and SDCflows.

23.0.2 (April 24, 2023)
=======================
Bug fix release in the 23.0.x series.

This release fixes issues with `_phase1+2`, `_phasediff` and `_fieldmap`
fieldmap files that are found with an orientation other than RAS.


23.0.1 (March 24, 2023)
=======================
Bug fix release in the 23.0.x series.

This release fixes issues with detecting partial fieldmaps, emitting a warning instead
of an error. A small change in sMRIPrep fixes the name of a workflow, which may cause a
duplication in a reused work directory from 23.0.0, but should not break any workflows
or produce a change in derivatives.


23.0.0 (March 13, 2023)
=======================
New feature release in the 23.0.x series.

This release adds improvements for workflows targeting the fsLR grayordinate space.
Namely, morphometric (curvature, sulcal depth and cortical thickness) measures are
output as ``.dscalar.nii`` files and high-variance voxels can be excluded from the
resampling step using ``--project-goodvoxels``.

Additionally, T2w images are now resampled to the T1w-defined subject space if FreeSurfer
reconstruction is used. If multiple T2w images are provided, they are merged into a single
image first.

PEPolar fieldmaps with R/L phase-encoding directions or in non-standard orientations
are now better supported. We continue to work toward better support for more SDC
configurations.

23.0.0 supports FreeSurfer 7.3.2, which is now bundled in the Docker image.

ICA-AROMA support will be removed in 23.1.0.

With thanks to Thomas Madison, Greg Conan, Celine Provins, Robert Smith and Yaroslav
Halchenko for contributions.
Thanks also to Steve Giavasis and colleagues at the Child Mind Institute
for feedback on SDC processing.

22.1.1 (January 04, 2023)
=========================
Bug fix release in the 22.1.x series.

This release fixes the reported version in the distributed Docker image,
and depends on SDCFlows 2.2.2, which fixes a bug affecting SDC estimation
in some oblique datasets.

  * FIX: Ensure version installed in Docker file is clean (#2922)


22.1.0 (December 12, 2022)
==========================
New feature release in the 22.1.x series.

This is an incremental improvement on the 22.0.x series, including features and fixes that
are backwards incompatible with the 22.0.x work tree.

Several significant issues with susceptibility distortion correction (SDC) have been fixed
in `SDCFlows 2.2.0`_, in addition to the changes listed below.
If you have been seeing issues with SDC in 21.0.x or 22.0.x, please test out this version
and submit issues.

Additionally, this version includes improvements to structural preprocessing, generating
morphometric ``.shape.gii`` files from FreeSurfer derivatives.

Finally, this release introduces a method for estimating the carbon footprint of using
fMRIPrep. Add ``--track-carbon`` to your command to try this out. Note that it does not work
in Docker containers, but should work for Singularity containers.

  * FIX: Filter sbrefs by BIDS filters if available (#2843)

21.0.2 (April 21, 2022)
=======================
Bug-fix release in the 21.0.x series.

This release includes a few bug-fixes for susceptibility distortion correction (SDC) and multi-echo (ME).
A few notable fixes include:
- Added tolerance for affine precision differences when using EPI fieldmaps.
- Removed hang-ups when reusing anatomical derivatives with ME data.
- Increased BOLD masking workflow robustness.

A full list of changes can be found below:

  * DOCKER: Update multiarch deb package link (#2758)
  * ENH: Add affine_tolerance flag to MergeSeries (nipreps/niworkflows#706)
  * FIX: Initialize BIDS layout after cleaning working directory (#2741)

  * FIX: Relax tolerance for different affines when concatenating blips (nipreps/sdcflows#265)

21.0.1 (January 24, 2022)
=========================
Bug-fix release in the 21.0.x series.

This release re-enables reverse-PE EPI fieldmaps, i.e. EPIs acquired with the
opposite phase-encoding direction to a BOLD series.
Additionally, the ``--use-syn-sdc`` option will now error by default if no
``PhaseEncodingDirection`` can be found for a BOLD series. To reduce this to
a warning, use ``--use-syn-sdc warn``. SyN-SDC will NOT be run, but the workflow
will proceed.

.. note::

  ``topup`` runtime scales with the number of volumes used, so fMRIPrep defaults to
  using a maximum of 5 volumes from each of the BOLD series and the EPI fieldmap.
  To adjust this, please use the ``--topup-max-vols`` parameter.

* FIX: Create single fmap_select_std node for use with all ANAT estimators (#2692)

* MNT: Restore nitime to requirements, necessary for DVARS (#2678)

21.0.0 (December 14, 2021)
==========================
A new series is finally here!

Some highlights of this version's new features include a substantial rework of fMRIPrep's
susceptibility distortion correction (including the addition of FSL's ``topup`` as the new
default PEPOLAR correction technique), improved flexibility for multiecho scans, and
dependency version upgrades within the Docker environment.

.. note::

  To follow BIDS Derivatives more closely, *fMRIPrep*'s default output layout has changed.
  To enable the legacy layout, use the ``--output-layout legacy`` flag.

20.2.1 (November 06, 2020)
==========================
Bug-fix release in the 20.2.x LTS series.

This release adds missing metadata to GIFTI and CIFTI-2 derivatives and fixes a logging
bug affecting a small number of datasets.

Additionally the ``--output-layout bids`` flag will now output fMRIPrep derivatives directly
into the output directory, nesting FreeSurfer derivatives by default in
``<output>/sourcedata/freesurfer``. This layout allows the output root to be a valid BIDS
Derivatives dataset, simplifying data management and provenance tracking with content tracking
tools, such as `DataLad <https://handbook.datalad.org/>`__. This layout will likely become the
default in future release series.

* ENH: Output TaskName and timing metadata for all resampled BOLD series (#2320)
* ENH: Add ``--output-layout`` CLI option to enable BIDS (YODA) mode (#2303)
* ENH: Add Docker authentication to increase pull rate limit (#2316)
* FIX: Specify logger for warning (#2298)

20.2.0 (September 28, 2020)
===========================
With this third minor release series of 2020,
the first *fMRIPrep LTS* (*long-term support*) is finally here!

This release contains a number of bug-fixes and enhancements mostly
related to easing the maintenance, anticipating patch-release breaking
changes to ensure a longstanding LTS, and addressing some run-to-run
repeatability problems of the CompCor implementation.

.. admonition:: Long-Term Support (LTS)

    *fMRIPrep* 20.2 LTS introduces the `long-term support program
    <https://www.nipreps.org/devs/releases/#long-term-support-series>`__.
    This LTS version will be kindly steered and maintained by
    the group of Dr. Basile Pinsard and Prof. Pierre Bellec at
    `CRIUGM <https://criugm.qc.ca/>`__, (Université de Montréal).
    The LTS is planned for a window of 4 years of support (i.e., until
    September 2024).

20.1.0 (May 27, 2020)
=====================
The second minor release series of 2020 is finally here!

*fMRIPrep* 20.1.0 introduces a magnitude of new features and improvements.
Originally nominated to become the first LTS (long-term support) version of *fMRIPrep*,
this release has been supercharged with many new features and bug-fixes.
To ensure long-term stability, we have postponed the LTS nomination to 20.2
to allow us unlocking the 20.1 earlier, and a more extensive stress testing of
the series before jumping into a longer support commitment.
Some key additions in this release include:

- A centralized `configuration module
  <https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#module-fmriprep.config>`__
  keeping track of *fMRIPrep*'s many options and run-time and environmental
  circumstances and settings.
  The new config module, which has been also propagated to other *NiPreps*
  (`dMRIPrep <https://nipreps.org/dmriprep>`__,
  `MRIQC <https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/>`__),
  comes to robustify the run-to-run replicability of *fMRIPrep* (e.g., tracking random seeds),
  make the option handling more modular but consistent (e.g., setting the ground for a
  command-line interface built off of the config module),
  and ease troubleshooting and telemetry.
- The `anatomical preprocessing fast-track
  <https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#the-anatomical-fast-track>`__:
  a new experimental command-line option (``--anat-derivatives <PATH>``) checks that
  all necessary anatomical derivatives
  required by *fMRIPrep* are present under ``<PATH>``, and skips the anatomical
  processing in full if *fMRIPrep*'s expectations are met.
  Because now functional processing of many sessions and runs can be efficiently
  split into more digestible computational units (i.e., cluster job) while guaranteeing the
  exact same anatomical results are being used, this can significantly speed up
  longitudinal study preprocessing, and it is a fundamental optimization to process
  databases of densely scanned individuals such as `My Connectome
  <https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000031>`__.
  This option is not recommended for single-session processing.
- A change in output CIFTI2 subcortical volume orientation to be compatible with HCP Pipeline tools and data.

20.0.x series (February 2020)
=============================
20.0.7 (May 5, 2020)
--------------------
Bug-fix release in the 20.0.x series.

This release includes a new, portable version of the templateflow python client. This includes an
automatic check to fetch the latest templateflow templates every time.

* MAINT: Bump templateflow to auto-update template skeleton

20.0.6 (April 16, 2020)
-----------------------
Bug-fix release in the 20.0.x series.

This release fixes a bug for **phase-difference fieldmaps that are not in RAS+ orientation**.
The bug presented as an error if the orientation was reordered relative to RAS+ (for example,
AIL+) and the swapped dimensions were not of the same size.
Otherwise, the bug introduced a poor masking of the phase difference map, and could be quite subtle
if the original orientation was LAS+.
Runs of fMRIPrep that used other susceptibility distortion correction (SDC) methods are not
currently considered problematic.

This bug affects all earlier versions of fMRIPrep, except for 1.5.10 and any future releases in
the 1.5.x series.

  * FIX: Do not reorient magnitude images (`nipreps/sdcflows#98`_)

.. _`nipreps/sdcflows#98`: https://github.com/nipreps/sdcflows/pull/98

20.0.5 (March 19, 2020)
-----------------------
Bug-fix release in 20.0.x series.

With thanks to James Kent for the fix and Blaise Frederick for the report and testing.

  * FIX: Add CE agent to output figure filename templates (`nipreps/niworkflows#482`_)

.. _`nipreps/niworkflows#482`: https://github.com/nipreps/niworkflows/pull/482

20.0.4 (March 17, 2020)
-----------------------
A bug-fix release improving documentation for filtering BIDS files and standardizing CIFTI volume orientation.

With thanks to Ursula Tooley for the contribution.

  * DOC: FAQ section for BIDS filter (#2028)
  * FIX: Ensure BOLD and label orientations are equal (`nipreps/niworkflows#477`_).

.. _`nipreps/niworkflows#477`: https://github.com/nipreps/niworkflows/pull/477

20.0.3 (March 12, 2020)
-----------------------
A bug-fix release for CIFTI surfaces.

This release remedies a resampling error when generating fsLR surfaces that was producing erroneous CIFTI files.
**We strongly recommend all users who have generated CIFTI output with previous 20.0.x releases to upgrade and rerun**.

   * FIX: Remedy fsLR surface resampling (#2032)

20.0.2 (March 6, 2020)
----------------------
A bug squashing release in the 20.0.x series.

This release fixes the use of custom templates within the docker wrapper, remedies crashes
when FreeSurfer HOME was not set, and improves the documentation for local installations.

With thanks to Blaise Frederick for the contribution.

  * DOC: Update standalone installation requirements (#2009)
  * FIX: Crashes whenever FREESURFER_HOME is not set (#2014)
  * FIX: Local template mounting (wrapper) (#2020)
  * MAINT: Pin minor series of nipype, major series of nibabel (#2021)

20.0.1 (February 27, 2020)
--------------------------
Bug-fix release in 20.0.x series.

This release includes fixes for rare images with invalid qform matrices and some minor
improvements in report readability and inclusion of common templates in the Docker image.

  * FIX: Handle qforms with invalid quaternions (`nipreps/niworkflows#466`_)
  * FIX: update niworkflows location (#2005)
  * ENH: Display errors as summary/details elements in reports (`nipreps/niworkflows#464`_)
  * DOC: Add ``--fs-subjects-dir`` usage to slurm example (#2003)
  * CI: Test that Docker image can run a common set of output spaces without network access (#1997)

.. _`nipreps/niworkflows#466`: https://github.com/nipreps/niworkflows/pull/466

20.0.0 (February 24, 2020)
--------------------------
The major release of 2020 is here!

*fMRIPrep* is transitioning to a calendar version system
(`#1912 <https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/issues/1912>`__).
The `CalVer <https://calver.org/>`__ system reflects *fMRIPrep*'s nature
as an evolving workflow and does not impose any artificial incentive for
"big-change" releases.
It also permits to quickly see how out-of-date someone's version is.
As of now, the *default* version increment is the minor release number.
Hence, when the minor release number changes the work directory of *fMRIPrep*
will presumably break.
Micro releases only include bug-fixes that can reuse exiting working directories.

The major highlight of this release entails CIFTI generation to match
:abbr:`HCP (Human Connectome Project)` *grayordinates*.
In addition, the new *fMRIPrep 20.0.0* has gone through a major overhaul in the
handling of standard spaces (spatial normalizations, fusion of prior knowledge from
corresponding atlases) and imaging outputs.
In particular, the new series almost completely implements the new
syntax for ``--output-spaces`` to describe the (non)standard spatial references
that shall be used for generating outputs
(`#1604 <https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/issues/1604>`__).

This release includes contributions from Azeez Adebimpe and Basile Pinsard - very much appreciated.

  * ENH: Warn when existing output version does not match current pipeline version (#1967)
  * ENH: Add ``--clean-workdir`` argument (#1966)
  * ENH: Refactor of how spatial normalization targets and ``--output-spaces`` are maintained (#1955) (#1983)
  * ENH: Add ``--bids-filter-file`` argument for more controlled data querying (#1770)
  * FIX: Ensure subject ID is used when selecting BIDS data (#1982)
  * FIX: Display a log message when processing completes successfully (#1977)
  * DOC: Clean up surface outputs (#1993)
  * DOC: Integrate intersphinx, drop external module wrapping (#1989)
  * DOC: Improve custom template usage description (#1969)
  * MAINT: Use local docker registry (#1990)
  * MAINT: Pin connectome-workbench 1.3.2, add to documented dependencies (#1958)
  * MAINT: Pin NiBabel, NiWorkflows, sMRIPrep (#1971)
  * MAINT: CI build error fixes (#1976)

1.5.x series (September 2019)
=============================
1.5.10 (April 16, 2020)
-----------------------
Bug-fix release in the 1.5.x series.

This release fixes a bug for **phase-difference fieldmaps that are not in RAS+ orientation**.
The bug presented as an error if the orientation was reordered relative to RAS+ (for example,
AIL+) and the swapped dimensions were not of the same size.
Otherwise, the bug introduced a poor masking of the phase difference map, and could be quite subtle
if the original orientation was LAS+.
Runs of fMRIPrep that used other susceptibility distortion correction (SDC) methods are not
currently considered problematic.

This bug affects all previous versions of fMRIPrep, as well as versions 20.0.0-20.0.5.

  * FIX: Do not reorient magnitude images (`nipreps/sdcflows#98`_)

.. _`nipreps/sdcflows#98`: https://github.com/nipreps/sdcflows/pull/98

1.5.9 (February 14, 2020)
-------------------------
Bug-fix release in the 1.5.x series.

This release fixes a bug for some phase maps generated by Philips. A full fix with better handling
of all phase maps will be available in an upcoming minor release (20.0 or 20.1), but this should permit
users who are processing with 1.5.x to resolve this issue in a way that does not affect phase maps
unaffected by the bug.

  * FIX: Center phase maps around central mode, avoiding FoV-related outliers (nipreps/sdcflows#89)

1.5.8 (January 28, 2020)
------------------------

1.5.7 (January 23, 2020)
------------------------
Bug-fix release in the 1.5.x series.

This release fixes a bug specifically for T1w images with dimensions ≤256 voxels
but a field-of-view >256mm.

  * FIX: Calculate FoV with shape and zooms (nipreps/smriprep#161)

1.5.6 (January 22, 2020)
------------------------
Bug-fix release in the 1.5.x series.

1.5.0 (September 9, 2019)
-------------------------
Two hallmark changes conducive to a new minor release line have been included in
version 1.5.0: the upgrade of *PyBIDS* to the 0.9 series and the split of *SDCflows*
off from *fMRIPrep* codebase.
*PyBIDS* 0.9.x has a better handling of the indexed dataset that will permit some
optimizations to *fMRIPrep*'s memory fingerprint.
*SDCflows* now are found at `nipreps/sdcflows <https://github.com/nipreps/sdcflows>`__,
and have been split to allow a more granular and thorough testing in collaboration
with M. Cieslak, A. Adebimpe, and T. Satterthwaite.
Some other bugfixes, improvements to the documentation and minor features are also
shipped with the new release.
With thanks to Ursula Tooley, Sebastian Urchs and Gabriel A. Devenyi for contributions.

1.4.x series (May 2019)
=======================
1.4.1 (July 9, 2019)
--------------------
As of 1.4.1, the new infant and pediatric templates added to TemplateFlow are available to
brain extraction and spatial normalization.
Containers do not set the ``TEMPLATEFLOW_HOME`` environment variable anymore, allowing
increased flexibility when running them (especially Singularity, for which the filesystem
is generally set read-only).
Additionally, BOLD files in native space can be generated and a minor bug related to the
handling of FreeSurfer outputs have been included.

* FIX: Finalizing support for new templates and their command line modifiers (#1671) @oesteban

1.4.0 (May 15, 2019)
--------------------
The new 1.4 series include several new features, several maintenance patches,
and numerous bugfixes.
The largest change to *fMRIPrep*'s interface is the new ``--output-spaces``
argument that allows running spatial normalization to one or more standard
templates, and also to indicate that data preprocessed and resampled to the
individual's anatomical space should be generated.
The implementation of this option will be completed in future releases to include
new nonstandard spaces (e.g., this BOLD run's native space) and custom templates
providing a path.
For example, the following *fMRIPrep* options: ::

  --template MNI152NLin6Asym --output-space template T1w fsaverage5 ----template-resampling-grid 2mm

now would be accomplished with: ::

  --output-spaces MNI152NLin6Asym:res-2 anat fsaverage:den-10k

with the difference that more templates could be specified if needed, e.g., ::

  --output-spaces MNI152NLin6Asym:res-2 anat fsaverage:den-10k MNI152NLin2009cAsym:native

Related anatomical preprocessing workflows from *sMRIPrep* have gone through
thorough revisions.
In particular, the brain extraction workflow now is implemented in pure Nipype.

Users will notice the addition of two new subsections in the reports generated by
*fMRIPrep*.
The first addition describes the cumulative variance explained by successive a/tCompCor
components.
A second addition shows the correlations between the confounding regressors that
*fMRIPrep* writes to the corresponding file, and their correlation to the global signal.

Series 1.4 increasingly relies on PyBIDS to handle not only inputs, but also outputs and
reporting.
The reports generation system has been deeply refactored to improve its generalizability
across BIDS-Apps and addressing some rendering problems (e.g., when resizing ICA-AROMA
components decompositions).
Finally, there were several updates to packaging, testing and documentation, which should
hopefully improve the experience for new users and contributors.

1.2.0 (October 31, 2018)
------------------------
This release marks a substantial renaming of derivatives to conform to the BIDS Derivatives specification [release candidate](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ebopupQxuRwp7U7TFvS6BH03ALJOgGHufxK8ToAvyI/).

The most significant additional change is a substantial revision of BOLD skull-stripping, using a BOLD template constructed from many open datasets. Building off the work of Zhifang Ye (see #1050), the skull-stripping is now much more resilient to intensity inhomogeneity.

With many thanks to Ali Cohen, James Kent, Inge Amlien, Sebastian Urchs, and Zhifang Ye for contributions.
